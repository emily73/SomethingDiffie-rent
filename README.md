# Something Diffie-rent

# Flag
Flag: `S3cR3T_D1fFi3_He11m4n_K3yZ_64`
# Briefing
We recently found this TCP service on `<ip>` port number `<portnumber>` which asks for a secret key. There appears to be an encoded message, but our agents couldnâ€™t work out what it meant.  Can you decode it and work out the secret key to access the flag?
